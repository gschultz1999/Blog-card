## My process

I find starting with the fundamentals in HTML and just setting up the skeleton and nesting your elements is best. Then creating classes and ID's based on what you want to target in css. Afterwards I move to css and go from top to bottom, outside to in. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- CSS flex

### What I learned



### Continued development

I still feel like my ability to move objects around and size things appropriately needs to be worked on. Also my ability to alter content based on the screen size. 

### Useful resources

- [MDN media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) - I used this to look into media queries
- [:hover in MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) - This link showed me how the pseduo elements in CSS work, specifically :hover, which I used to change the color of the text on hover.
